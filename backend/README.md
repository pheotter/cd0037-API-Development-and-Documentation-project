# Backend - Trivia API
This project is a virtual Trivia. You are able to add questions to the trivia, delete questions, and quiz yourself about the knowledge in specific area. As a part of the Fullstack Nanodegree, it serves as a practice module for lessons of API Development and Documentation. By completing this project, I applied skills structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. Now, let's get started!

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All required packages are included in the requirements file.

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql -U postgres trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `/backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask run
```

Setting the FLASK_DEBUG variable to true means that we are working in development mode and it shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made.

Setting the FLASK_APP variable to flaskr will directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder

The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.

### Testing
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql -U postgres trivia_test < trivia.psql
python3 test_flaskr.py
```
The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. 
All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. 

## API Reference
### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Not Processable
